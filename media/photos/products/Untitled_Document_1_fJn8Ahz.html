Here's an example of a product details page with a zoom effect on hover, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Product Details</title>
  <style>
    .product-image {
      position: relative;
      width: 300px;
      height: 300px;
      overflow: hidden;
    }

    .product-image img {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      object-fit: cover;
      transition: transform 0.3s ease;
    }

    .product-image:hover img {
      transform: scale(2);
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="product-details">
    <div class="product-image">
      <img src="product-image.jpg" alt="Product Image">
    </div>
    <h2>Product Name</h2>
    <p>Product Description...</p>
    <p>Price: $99.99</p>
    <button>Add to Cart</button>
  </div>

  <script>
    const productImage = document.querySelector('.product-image');
    const img = productImage.querySelector('img');

    productImage.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
      const x = e.clientX - e.target.offsetLeft;
      const y = e.clientY - e.target.offsetTop;

      img.style.transformOrigin = `${x}px ${y}px`;
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have a `.product-image` container with an image inside it. The CSS styles set the container to have a fixed size and the image to cover the entire container. The `overflow: hidden` property ensures that any part of the image that goes beyond the container's boundaries is clipped.

The zoom effect is achieved by scaling the image up to 2 times its original size on hover (`.product-image:hover img { transform: scale(2); }`). The `transition` property adds a smooth animation to the scaling effect.

The JavaScript code listens for the `mousemove` event on the `.product-image` container. When the user moves the mouse over the image, it calculates the relative coordinates of the mouse pointer within the container and sets the `transformOrigin` property of the image accordingly. This causes the image to zoom in from the point where the mouse is positioned, creating a more natural zooming effect.

Note that you'll need to replace `product-image.jpg` with the actual path to your product image file.

You can further enhance this example by adding additional product details, styling, and functionality as needed.
